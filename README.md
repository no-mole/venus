* **Highly Available** - Venus uses raft protocol to ensure data synchronization to enough nodes.
* **Distributed** - Venus uses GRPC and HTTP/HTTPS to provide service portals, uses GRPC to process data communication of each node, 
and uses **boltdb** to store raft log and persistent data.
* **UI** - Venus comes with a panel and support password login or oidc loginï¼Œit is very convenient to manage configuration items and services.
